Q.Should the Data Be in JSON Instead?
ANS: While TSV is fine for structured tabular data, JSON would make more sense if you want a structured format with nested data. For example, if you wanted each scheme's data to be an object, JSON would provide better flexibility for future processing (like APIs or applications).
